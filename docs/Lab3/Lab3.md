# Lab3
This is CsBugmakers' lab3 work. We divided into two groups and each submit one entire lab3 work to get more practice.
### Activity diagram:

 >Activity diagram help us elaborate workflows for key activities. With decision points, wait points and parallel work, we can describe the process of the software and relations among activities more clearly.
>>To draw this diagram, we take "add up to 120 credits" as a prerequisite and divide activities into three categories which need defalut approval, approval of head teaching, approval of modules convenoe & approval of head teaching respectively. And these three threads end with "submit".

### Sequence diagram:

>Compare to activity diagram, sequence diagram is a good way to represent interactions between components and activitys. It can elaborate dialogues between components by drawing message lines and reply lines as well as the order of the process.
>>Questions:
>>1. As the alt fragment represents a choice of behavior of which at most one of operands will be chosen and I didn't find the opt fragment, how can I draw the diagram to represent a situation that need if conditional statement.
>>2. What's the difference between actors and objects.
>>3. How to represent parallel activitis. Does it use asynchronous lines to represent?
