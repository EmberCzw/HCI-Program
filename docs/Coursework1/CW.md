## Introduction
Approched by Bank of China(Boc), we plan to develop an interesting new app, it helps customers to manage personal finance.
We decide to use user story and use case diagram to establish the requirements. 
By using **user story**, we figure out three actors which are **customers**, **multi-account users**, **joint-account users**. These actors have various requirements and user story elaborates what these users can do about their account by this app.

## User story

Elaborated by a set of user stories, we figure out three actors which are **customers**, **multi-account users**, **joint-account users**.We can clearly know which kind of user can do what. All customers can see what they spend on what category and types and how much they left each months. Also, user story describles that totals of each catogory can be updated and shown to all customers. Furthermore, for joint and multiple account users, user story can clearly tell their specific requirements as see information aboves as a single summary across all the accounts and who spent money respectively. If we do not use user story, it's hard to show users' requirements clearly.

## Use case diagram
Although user story can elaborate which user can do what clearly when using this app, there is still a lack of interactions between actors and activities, so we use use case diagram.

By using the use-case diagram, we can clearly understand and grasp the true actors, which is simple customer ,multi-account-users and joint-account-users.
because three of them all have some same requirements, so we use the 'customer' to include all the three son-actors

It can be user-centered and clearly show the relationship between son-actors and the 'customer', and also this makes it easier to show the user's relationship with the app's function, such as the joint-account user can konw who spent the money on their joint-accounts, and also mulit-accounts-users can check their total money on all his acounts and also the single detail of each account.
 
we chose the user story because it can better reflect the different functions required by different roles, which fits this topic and the use-case diagram.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we think these two activities can illstrate the function of this app and the methord for users to apply the app fair well. It can help us programmers to better realise the user's requirements and app's goal-user, what's more, such way of writing diagrams can improve the logical programming and inner-group's divison of mission.
